# Goose Watch 2.0

This project makes use of Angular.JS and the Google Maps API to interpret data from the [UW Open Data API](https://github.com/uWaterloo/api-documentation) to display custom markers onto the map.  

The goal of this project was to create a cleaner version of [Goose Watch '15](http://goose-watch.uwaterloo.ca) to allow users to conveniently view all of the goose nests around UW.
